# Fake News Detector (Multimodal)
This repository contains an open-source implementation of a multimodal fake news detection system that leverages text, images, and metadata. It is built for research and educational purposes only, and is inspired by the Fakeddit benchmark dataset.

## Features

Multimodal pipeline:
Text encoder (e.g., Mistral 7B, Llama, or BERT-style models)
Image encoder (e.g., ResNet, CLIP-ViT)
Metadata encoder (simple MLP for structured data)


Fusion of text, image, and metadata embeddings
